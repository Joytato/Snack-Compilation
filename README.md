# Snack-Compilation
This contains some basic C++ programs that we were taught in Grade 8 (2018-2019).

## Background
These were activities given during our computer class and done in pairs. I got to pair up with my best friend Bianca and we named the folder <b>Snack Compilation</b> as a silly joke. It might not be much but it's pretty iconic to me and it sparked my interest in programming.
